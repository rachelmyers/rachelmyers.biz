        <p><a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> is an organization that teaches marginalized groups Ruby, Rails, and Frontend development.</p>
        <p>The RailBridge community and workshops were a huge help to me when I started programming, and I started teaching as soon as I was able. I'm currently on the RailsBridge Board of Directors and volunteer regularly at workshops in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get involved, check out <a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/">Bridge Troll</a> for a workshop near you, start an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues">Organizing Repo</a>, or help us maintain the <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">curriculum</a>!
